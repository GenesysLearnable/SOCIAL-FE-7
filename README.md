- `next.config.js`
- `package.json`
- `README.md`

## Key Components

### Authentication (`auth.jsx`)

The `auth.jsx` file handles user authentication, including sign-up, log-in, and Google OAuth. The component uses Redux for state management and React Toastify for notifications.

**Key Functions**:

- `handleRegisterButton`: Handles user registration.
- `handleLoginButton`: Handles user login.
- `handleGoogleSignUp`: Redirects to Google OAuth.

### Call (`call.jsx`)

The `call.jsx` file manages the video call functionality and allows users to search for friends, add friends, and handle friend requests. It also includes a settings component for user settings.

**Key Functions**:

- `handleAddFriend`: Navigates to the add friends page.
- `handleFriendRqt`: Navigates to the update friends page.

### Profile Setup (`profile.jsx`)

The `profile.jsx` file handles user profile setup, including updating the username and profile picture. It uses the react-image-file-resizer library to resize images and Redux for state management.

**Key Functions**:

- `handleImageChange`: Resizes and sets the profile picture.
- `handleSave`: Updates the user profile.

- Running the Development Server

    `npm run dev`
- Building the Project for Production

    `npm run build`
    `npm run start`
- Running the Project

- Sign Up: Navigate to the sign-up page, fill in the required fields, and create an account.
- Log In: Navigate to the login page, enter your credentials, and log in to your account.

- Notes
Ensure that your API endpoints and authentication configurations are correctly set in the .env file.
For Google OAuth, configure your Google Developer Console and update the necessary endpoints in the backend.

- Conclusion
This README file provides a comprehensive overview of the SeeMe project, including its structure, key components, and usage instructions. Follow the steps outlined to set up and run the project, and refer to the code for detailed implementation of the authentication, call, and profile setup functionalities.

In this example, we used two spaces at the end of the line in the "Notes" section to create a line break. For paragraphs, we simply left a blank line between them. This helps keep the README file well-structured and easy to read.
